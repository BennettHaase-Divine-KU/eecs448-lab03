			<p class="Bio">
				Emperor Constantine was a Roman Emperor in the 3th century. He was a fairly swell guy who managed to do a lot of conquering (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July">as is roman tradition</a>). He is most famous for naming  a thing after himself (another roman tradition) in this case a city, Istanbul (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gHRFuOlYfs">was Constantinople</a>) He also declared himself the emperor of the whole empire, which was administratively split (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate">yet another </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Triumvirate">roman tradition</a>) which shortly  after fell apart again and was eventually  destroyed in 1453. He also did some other stuff probably... Something about church and state, I'm not too sure wikipedia probably knows. He was a saint though which is kinda cool, especially since he killed and conquered a whole lot, truly an inspiration to us all, assuming you want to be both a roman emperor and a saint of which there are a few.

			Overall, I hope this website did not do that much damage to your mental state, I am a EECS student not an artist- all I know how to do is make art worse.
